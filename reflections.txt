# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
  - I used Formatador to format the table when all and filter are called.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Allows developers to add new item types easily. Simply add a file with a class that inherits from Item, then call list.register_new_type(file_name, class_name)
  b) Allows users to change priority value, and of course, I take "garbage in - garbage out" into account.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  - I spent probably 6 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  - The most rewarding part was getting the feature a.) New Types working.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  - I decided to allow developers to add their owns files and register them as child classes of Item because it seemed interesting. Alternatively, I could put all Items as one class called Item, then I can dynamically add new types without a developer having to add files. 
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  - I sometimes juggling too many things at a time, and tend to forget about little details, which leads to me spending a decent amount of time on bugs.
